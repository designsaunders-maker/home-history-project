# bcrypt to bcryptjs Migration

## Overview

Successfully migrated from `bcrypt` to `bcryptjs` across the entire project. This migration improves compatibility and removes the need for native compilation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Dependencies

**File: `backend/package.json`**

**Removed:**
- `bcrypt: ^5.1.1` (requires native compilation)
- `@types/bcrypt: ^5.0.2`

**Added:**
- `bcryptjs: ^2.4.3` (pure JavaScript implementation)
- `@types/bcryptjs: ^2.4.6`

### 2. User Model

**File: `backend/models/User.ts`**

**Changed:**
```typescript
// Before
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

// After
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
```

The rest of the bcrypt API remains the same, as bcryptjs provides a compatible interface:
- `bcrypt.genSalt(10)` - works identically
- `bcrypt.hash(password, salt)` - works identically
- `bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, hashedPassword)` - works identically

## Benefits of bcryptjs

### ✅ Advantages:

1. **No Native Compilation**: Pure JavaScript implementation means no need for node-gyp or native build tools
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
3. **Vercel/Serverless Compatible**: Works perfectly in serverless environments
4. **Same API**: Drop-in replacement with identical API
5. **Well Maintained**: Actively maintained with good TypeScript support

### ⚠️ Trade-offs:

1. **Slightly Slower**: Pure JS is ~30% slower than native bcrypt (still very secure)
2. **For Password Hashing**: The speed difference is negligible for password hashing (a few ms)

## Implementation Details

### Password Hashing (User.ts)

The User model uses bcryptjs for:

1. **Password Hashing on Save:**
```typescript
userSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
  if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();
  
  try {
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error as Error);
  }
});
```

2. **Password Comparison:**
```typescript
userSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function(candidatePassword: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    return await bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password);
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Next.js Considerations

**Note**: This project uses Express.js, not Next.js. If you were using Next.js, you would need to:

1. Export `runtime = 'nodejs'` in any route files using bcryptjs
2. Use dynamic imports for the hasher in API routes

Example for Next.js (not needed in this project):
```typescript
// app/api/auth/route.ts
export const runtime = 'nodejs';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Dynamic import for bcryptjs
  const bcrypt = await import('bcryptjs');
  
  const { password } = await request.json();
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
  
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

## Testing

To verify the migration:

1. **Test User Registration:**
   - Create a new user
   - Verify password is hashed in database

2. **Test User Login:**
   - Login with correct password (should succeed)
   - Login with incorrect password (should fail)

3. **Test Existing Users:**
   - Existing hashed passwords should still work
   - bcryptjs can verify hashes created by bcrypt

## Installation

The migration is complete. Dependencies have been updated:

```bash
cd backend
npm uninstall bcrypt @types/bcrypt
npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs
```

## Compatibility

- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: bcryptjs can verify hashes created by native bcrypt
- ✅ **Forward Compatible**: Native bcrypt can verify hashes created by bcryptjs
- ✅ **No Database Migration Needed**: Existing password hashes continue to work

## Security

Both bcrypt and bcryptjs use the same algorithm and provide the same level of security:
- Bcrypt algorithm with configurable work factor (salt rounds)
- Default 10 rounds provides strong security
- Resistant to rainbow table attacks
- Automatically handles salt generation

The only difference is the implementation (native C++ vs pure JavaScript), not the security.
